# code_quiz

For this homework assignment, I created a code-related quiz. The object is for the user to answer as many questions correctly in the time alloted. Every correct answer will add points towards the final score, and an incorrect answer will result in no points added towards the final score along with extra time lost. When the game is over, the user will be able to submit their name or inititals, and their score will be recorded.
